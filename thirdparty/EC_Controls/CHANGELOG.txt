  or to the right now. Caption is centered when Margin=-1 (default).
  Margin>=0 aligns to the left or right (it also depends on BiDiMode).

2015-04-16 0.9.2.4
==================
TECSlider: Min can be set >Max and Max can be set <Min while Updating (UpdateCount>0).
TECSpinEdit and TECSpinBtns: Min can be set >Max, Max can be set <Min and
  Middle can be set <Min or >Max while Updating (UpdateCount>0).

2015-04-13 0.9.2.2
===================
TECCheckListBox and TECColorCombo can now change Font.Color (hardcoded
  clWindowText replaced by GetColorResolvingDefault(Font.Color, clWindowText);)

2015-04-08 0.9.2.0
===================
Added new visual component TECHeader
  It is similar to THeaderControl. It has property BreakIndex, so some
  sections can be aligned to left and the others to the right.
Added property Spacing (space between CheckColumns). Indent is now padding of
  the boundary CheckColumn.

2015-04-06 0.9.1.20
===================
TECCheckListBox: event OnItemClick is now NOT triggered when State is changed
  from code.

2015-03-03 0.9.1.18
===================
TCustomECSpinBtns: corrected memleaks when changing Parent.
  It was creating new bitmaps for buttons whenever CreateWnd was called.
  Now it run only once.

2015-03-03 0.9.1.18
===================
New published property ShowCaption for TECSpeedBtn (because of unwanted Caption
  when TECSpeedBtn is linked with Action).

2015-03-03 0.9.1.18
===================
Published properties OnDragDrop and OnDragOver of TECSpeedBtn.

2015-02-26 0.9.1.18
===================
Added property Flat to TECCustomSpeedBtn
  It can be used only in Mode = ebmSpeedBtn.

2015-02-02 0.9.1.18
===================
Added new visual component TECCheckListBox
  It is similar to TCheckListBox but it can have more chekable boolean columns.
Improved Alternate color of TECImageMenu.

2015-01-14 0.9.1.16
===================
TConfCurve: Added OnClick, OnDblClick and OnContextPopup to published properties.
Added eosThemedPanel to TObjectStyle. TECSlider, TECProgressBar, TECPositionBar,
  TECSwitch, TECCheckGroup, TECRadioGroup, TECRuler and (partially) TECBevel
  can have themed panel (ttPane) background now.

2015-01-02 0.9.1.16
===================
New glyphs is TGlyphDesign. egdEmpty, egdFrame, egdGuidelines and themed:
egdRadioOff, egdRadioOn, egdCheckOff, egdCheckOn.

2015-01-01 0.9.1.16
===================
Added boolean property DropDownGlyph to TCustomECSpeedBtn. It gives combo-like
look to the button.

2014-12-27 0.9.1.16
===================
Added new visual component TECConfCurve
  It allows to configure curve on defined range. It has two bound points
  and as many points between them necessary. Each point can be dragged by
  mouse. Points can be fixed to X or Y axis and snapped to grid.
  Curve can have linear parts or can be continous (Bezier) with defined smoothness.

2014-12-22 0.9.1.14
===================
TECLink: default cursor changed to crHandPoint
TCanvasHelper: added method DrawFocusRectNonThemed
Modified FocusRect of TECSlider, TECSwitch and TECGroupCtrls.
(Reason: themed focus rect of Oxygen is underline, it is not
 suitable for TECKnob an for vertical captions)
Added AccessibilityRole to constructors.

2014-11-13 0.9.1.14
===================
Improved TCustomSpinBtns. Creating bitmaps is moved from constructor to
  CreateWnd. (There were bug: spinbtns were invisible when they were
  created on inactive tab of pagecontrol). Bitmaps are created only
  when TSingleSpinBtn.Visible is true (more efficient when small buttons
  are loaded from stream with property Visible = False).

2014-11-09 0.9.1.14
===================
Added new visual component TECLink
  It is alternative to TLabel or TStaticText. It can open URL in default
  browser, e-mail in default client or file in associated application.

2014-10-22 0.9.1.12
===================
Added {%MainUnit} directive to ecdrawglyph.inc.

2014-10-17 0.9.1.12
===================
Classes with abstract method are now defined as "class abstract".
  It will trigger compiler hint now - to avoid unwanted instantionation.

Improved changing Parent of grouped controls (TECSpinEdit, TECEditBtn, TECComboBtn,
  TECColorBtn and TECColorCombo). It does not write bunch of messages
  (Invalid anchors) to console now.

2014-10-02 0.9.1.12
===================
Replaced
inherited Resize;
with
inherited WMSize(Message);
in method TCustomSpinBtns.WMSize(var Message: TLMSize);

2014-09-24 0.9.1.12
===================
TECSpeedBtn: added property Mode, added event OnHoldDown, added entries to docs.
  Formerly: Delay < 0 .. ToggleBox
            Delay = 0 .. SpeedBtn
            Delay > 0 .. DelayBtn
  Now: use property Mode
  Note: Delay has no effect for ebmToggleBox.
        It has effect for ebmDelayBtn (delay before release).
        It has effect for ebmSpeedBtn (delay for OnHoldDown event).

2014-09-24 0.9.1.12
===================
Added new visual component TECBevel
  It allows to create non-rectangular boxes or frames (lowered or raised) and "zigzag" lines (separators).

2014-09-21 0.9.1.12
===================
TECGroupCtrls: Win32 issue - changed default Captions
  cDefCaption+inttostr(ID); instead of cDefCaption+inttostr(Index);

2014-09-20 0.0.1.11
===================
License changet to modified LGPL.

2014-09-19 0.0.1.11
===================
TCustomECColorCombo: SetItems(); now calls Validate. That's because
  Qt changes automatically ItemIndex from -1 to 0 when Items are assigned.

2014-09-18 0.0.1.11
===================
TCustomECImageMenu: text of selected item is no painted with clHighlightText
  when Font.Color = clDefault (Description)
  or CaptionFontOptions.FontColor = clDefault (Caption)

TCustomECImageMenu: new items Caption is Item.ID instead of Item.Index
  (method TImageMenuItems.Notify(...); better behavior under Wine)

2014-09-14 0.0.1.11
===================
TCustomECColorCombo: added visual feedback. Focused control is now
  painted highlighted and with focus rectangle around. (Windows)

TCustomECColorCombo: improved behavior in ItemOrder = eioHistory.
  Moving selected item to Index = 0 is moved from Select to EditingDone.

TCustomECColorCombo: Added method SetColorText(string).
(Reason: Setting Tet property must be followed by calling Validate;
  this method performs it itself.)

2014-07-31 0.0.1.11
===================
Improved PositionToHelp properties of TECSlider, TECRuler and TECPositionBar.
(added Forms to uses and modified MouseMove/MouseUp).

Added new visual component TECScheme
Added abstract class TBaseScrollControl to unit ECTypes,
this is based on ideas by Theo:
https://github.com/theo222/lazarus-thumbviewer/blob/master/scrollingcontrol.pas

TECSlider, TECProgressBar and TECPositionBar: removed OnStartDock from published

TECColorCombo: Improved vertical position of items (text).

TCustomSpinBtns code from Resize() moved to WMSize().
(Reason: Better optimalized code. LCL triggers more Resize(); and less WMSize().

TCustomECSpeedBtn is now derived from TGraphicControl (less is sometimes more)
TCustomECSpeedBtn now supports multi-line Caption (and uses composite string editor at design-time)
TCustomECSpeedBtn sets Delay to -1 when Checked is set to True in design time.

2014-05-13 0.0.1.9
==================
TECColorCombo now displays correctly items (closed and dropped-down normal/selected) in Win32/Qt4/GTK2.
(Reason: Canvas.Font.Color and Canvas.Brush.Color wasn't set properly to clWindowText, clHighlightText, clWindow and clHighlight).

Added small abstract class TBaseScrollControl to unit ECTypes. It manages scrollbars only.

Added glyphs egdSizeArrUp, egdSizeArrRight, egdSizeArrDown and egdSizeArrLeft to TGlyphDesign (and implemented in TCanvasHelper class).

Improved calculation of InvalidateRect of TCustomECGrpCtrls when Orientation = eooVertical.

TBaseECSlider (and descendants) are now created with DoubleBuffered = True.
(Reason: some users experienced flickering.)

Methods Resize(); are replaced with message methods WMSize(); (TCustomECSpeedBtn, TCustomECSwitch, TCustomECRuler, TBaseECSlider, TCustomECGrpCtrls).
(Reason: Better optimalized code. LCL triggers more Resize(); and less WMSize();.)

In TCustomECImageMenu.DrawItem() is (odSelected in State) replaced with Focused. It repairs calculation of item-background color in GTK2.
(Reason: (odSelected in State) does not work in GTK2.)

Improved repainting of TCustomECSpeedBtn and TCustomECRuler when these components are resized in GTK2.
(Reason: GTK2 needs extra Invalidate; on resizing, while Qt4 invalidates automatically.)

2014-05-09 0.0.1.7
===================
TCustomECGrpCtrls - controling via keyboard (0 for all up, 1..9 for switch items 0-8) is moved from KeyDown to KeyPress.
(Reason: GTk2 and Qt4 sends different key codes for 0..9, while KeyPress works properly.)

2014-04-25 0.0.1.7
===================
Initial release on Lazarus Mailing List.
