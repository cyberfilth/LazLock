Version 2.0
Complete rewrite of LazLock.

-LazLock 2 uses 128 bit Rijndael block encryption with a 256 bit key.
-Changed the design to a ListView that allows the user to organise their logins by category and reduce the amount of hunting / scrolling to find an entry.
-Improved the password generator by including more character options and a password strength bar. This bar is a rough guide that doesn't take dictionary attacks into account (as the password is randomly generated) but provides visual feedback to encourage the user to create more complex passwords.
-User interface has been simplified, icons and the right-click menu provides access to commonly used functions.

Version 0.8.0.0 - Version 1.0 (released 28/04/2016)
Used a very different codebase and presented data in the form of a spreadsheet.
This version encrypted data with a 64 bit Blowfish algorithm.
